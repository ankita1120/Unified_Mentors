# üß¨ COVID Clinical Trials ‚Äì EDA & Machine Learning

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applies a **Machine Learning (ML)** model to analyze a dataset of COVID-19 clinical trials. The goal is to understand key trends and build a predictive model to classify study types.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

- File: `COVID clinical trials.csv`
- Contains metadata about various clinical trials conducted for COVID-19.
- Common columns include: `Study Type`, `Status`, `Conditions`, `Interventions`, `Phases`, `Locations`, and more.

---

## üîç Features

- ‚úÖ Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, remove duplicates.
- ‚úÖ EDA: Summary statistics, distribution plots, value counts.
- ‚úÖ Label Encoding for categorical variables.
- ‚úÖ ML Model: Random Forest Classifier to predict if a trial is "Interventional".
- ‚úÖ Evaluation: Classification report and feature importance chart.

## üì¶ Requirements

Install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Download the dataset**: Make sure the CSV file is saved in your working directory.

2. **Run the script**: Use Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or a Python IDE of your choice.

3. **Adjust file path**: If needed, modify this line in the script to point to your dataset:
   ```python
   file_path = 'COVID clinical trials.csv'
   ```

---

## üìä Output

- Printed summary and structure of the dataset.
- Count plots showing distributions of study types and statuses.
- Accuracy score, classification report.
- Top feature importances plotted using a bar chart.

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Add more ML models for comparison (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost).
- Perform time-series analysis on trial start dates.
- Use NLP to extract insights from study descriptions.
