📊 IBM HR Attrition EDA & ML Project
🚀 Project Overview
Analyze and predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset with EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to generate actionable HR insights.

🎯 Objectives
Understand current attrition rates and patterns.

Identify key factors influencing employee attrition.

Build a Random Forest model to predict attrition.

Visualize feature importances and EDA insights for HR strategy.

🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Modeling: Random Forest Classifier

📂 Dataset
IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset

1470 rows × 35 columns

Includes Age, Department, DistanceFromHome, MonthlyIncome, JobRole, Overtime, etc.

🧩 Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning

Load dataset, check nulls, structure, and clean columns.

2️⃣ EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Attrition distribution.

Correlation heatmap.

Feature analysis vs. attrition (Age, Gender, Department).

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Label Encoding categorical columns.

4️⃣ Train-Test Split

80-20 split with stratification for balanced class distribution.

5️⃣ Scaling

StandardScaler for normalization.

6️⃣ Modeling

Train Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluate with accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.

7️⃣ Feature Importance

Visualize top features influencing attrition.

✅ Results
Identified key drivers like OverTime, JobRole, Age, MonthlyIncome impacting attrition.

Achieved strong predictive performance with Random Forest.

Clear, actionable visual insights for HR policy planning.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

Add SHAP for explainable ML.

Build Power BI/Tableau dashboards for business users.

Deploy as an HR analytics web app.

💡 Usage
